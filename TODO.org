* Features
** TODO Fully leverage the [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) package to parse config files.
   - If https://github.com/spf13/viper/pull/528 is accepted, this would mean it can `*.env` files directly.
** TODO Support flattening nested objects, e.g:

    {
        "a": {
            "b": {
                "c": 1
            }
            "d": {
                "e": 2
            }
        }
    }

to:

    a_b_c = 1
    a_b_d = 2

** TODO Support taking config from a Reader object
